## JAMR: a collaborative audiovisual experience
JAMR is a collaborative music-making application. It makes use of Firebase, and the Web Audio (via tone.js) and Bandsintown APIs. Users operate the three-octave, chromatic virtual piano keyboard from the home, QWERTY, and number rows of their computer keyboard.
